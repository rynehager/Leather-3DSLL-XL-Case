# 3DS XL/LL Case
An open design for a Nintendo 3DS XL/LL Case.

The plans (currently) call for 4/5oz leather, but can be modified to suit other thicknesses.

The simple version is you can do anything you want with these design files, so long as any tweaks you make are contributed back to the community! Don't let the attribution part scare you, that's really just a requirement in copyleft licenses to determine provenance and inheritance of the license from the earlier version. You don't have to credit me, just the previous design.
